## Recommendations

Recommendations for improving issue resolution:

- Implement issue templates to ensure consistent information
- Regularly review and prioritize older unresolved issues
- Assign issues to specific team members for accountability
- Provide detailed issue descriptions with clear steps to reproduce
- Involve relevant team members in issue discussions early
- Encourage active discussion on issues to clarify requirements and solutions

Significant factors affecting resolution time:

- Comment Count is 34.7% lower in quickly resolved issues
- Participant Count is 34.1% lower in quickly resolved issues
- Description Length is 60.9% higher in quickly resolved issues
