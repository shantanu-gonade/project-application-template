# Instructions for Generating SVG Files from Mermaid.js Specifications

To complete Milestone 1, you need to generate SVG files for both the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and the Class Diagram. Follow these steps to convert the text specifications to SVG images:

## Step 1: Access the Mermaid Live Editor

Go to the Mermaid Live Editor at:
https://www.mermaidchart.com/play#pako

## Step 2: Generate the ERD SVG

1. Open the file `team_4_erd.txt` and copy its entire contents
2. Paste the content into the left panel of the Mermaid Live Editor
3. The diagram should render in the right panel
4. Click on the "Export" button at the top right
5. Select "Image as SVG"
6. Save the file as `team_1_erd.svg`

## Step 3: Generate the Class Diagram SVG

1. Open the file `team_4_class_diagram.txt` and copy its entire contents
2. Paste the content into the left panel of the Mermaid Live Editor
3. The diagram should render in the right panel
4. Click on the "Export" button at the top right
5. Select "Image as SVG"
6. Save the file as `team_4_class_diagram.svg`

## Step 4: Verify the SVG Files

Make sure both SVG files are saved in the same directory as your other project files:

- `team_4_erd.svg`
- `team_4_class_diagram.svg`

These files, along with the text specifications and the repository URL, will be submitted for Milestone 1.
